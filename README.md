These are all of my solutions from the JavaScript Basics course at SoftUni.

The material I went through: 
  1. First Steps in Programming;
  2. Simple Operations and Calculations;
  3. Conditional Statements;
  4. Nested Conditional Statements;
  5. While Loop;
  6. For Loop;
  7. Nested Loops.

Each folder contains solutions from: 
  * Lab lecture exercises;
  * Exercise lecture exercises;
  * Previous exams that I used to prepare myself for the Mid Exam and the Final Exam.
  
Some of the solutions are simpler than others.
You might notice that I have used different techniques for some exercises, just because I wanted to experiment with which style might work the best for me.

I hope I could help students from the same learning path in SoftUni as me.
